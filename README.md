# Laravel-Learning-App
Laravel-Learning-App with MDBootstrap and TailwindCSS

I'm a complete noob with Github, version control, and the whole setup process.

This is a unstable, incomplete package.

It is interesting in the aspect of using the Tailwind CSS as main design formatting, and I am using MDB Bootstrap Material Design Bootstrap) to over-ride the Tailwind where neded to add the VUE components
I'm working slowly on trying to sepate out each main design components as separate Vue components for use with Laravel apps.
